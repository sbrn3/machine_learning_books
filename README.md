# machine_learning_books
Journey to being good at machine learning. Essentially here are the books I am reading at the moment and I thought it would be helpful to keep track and maybe review them as I go along. 

## Who is this for
A bit about my background. I did an undergraduate degree in micribiology but took many of my electives in maths and programming. Currently doing my honours in bioinformatics and trying to learn more about machine learning and statistics. If you are someone not from a strictly computer science background interested in learning more about AI and machine learning feel free to use this page as a resource to find good books and information.

### An Introduction to Statistical Learning
 This is a new version of the book Elements of Statistical Learning(ESL). However, ESL was intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences so this is similar however with a focus on the methods and less on the mathematical details. 

## Deep learning
